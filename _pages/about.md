From intelligent assistants that understand you to algorithms that predict the future, AI is my playground. I use data as my paintbrush, machine learning as my chisel, and NLP as my voice to sculpt solutions that tackle real-world challenges. Whether it's automating workflows, analyzing complex data, or building insightful language models, my passion for AI fuels my quest to innovate and make a positive impact.
